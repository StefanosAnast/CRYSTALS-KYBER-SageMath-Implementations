This work presents two SageMath implementations related to the CRYSTALS-KYBER key encapsulation mechanism (KEM). The first implementation is a minimal public-key encryption (PKE) scheme, providing a simplified version of KYBER to illustrate its core encryption and decryption processes. The second implementation is a more complete version of KYBER, incorporating all essential components except for the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT).
These implementations serve as an educational tool for exploring KYBER's design and functionality within a post-quantum cryptographic framework.
